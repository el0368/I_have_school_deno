# 📐 Understanding 3D Space

In traditional textbooks, you learn that **Volume** is the amount of space a 3D shape occupies.
The formula for a rectangular prism is:

$$ V = l \times w \times h $$

But what does that *feel* like?

## 1. The Interactive Prism
Instead of just looking at a static diagram, manipulate the dimensions below. Notice how the
volume grows much faster when you increase all three dimensions compared to just one.

<div style={{ padding: '20px', background: '#2b2d31', borderRadius: '8px', margin: '20px 0' }}>
  <VolumeSimulator />
</div>

## 2. Dynamic Text & Logic
We can even use JavaScript variables right inside our content.

export const author = "Sovereign Academy";
export const year = 2026;

> This lesson was crafted by **{author}** in **{year}**.

## 3. How far can we go?
With MDX, the line between "content" and "app" disappears. You can:
1. **Scrollytelling**: Trigger animations as the student reads.
2. **Live Code Editing**: Embed a code editor that executes live (like we do with WASM).
3. **Data Visualization**: Render charts that update based on user input elsewhere in the lesson.

For example, if we had a chart component, we could pass the volume data directly to it:

```tsx
<VolumeChart data={volumeSignal.value} />
```

*This file demonstrates the syntax of MDX. To render it, we would need to add an MDX plugin to our Fresh configuration.*
