Implementation Plan - Deno WebUI "Life Saver"
In response to your request for a "Life Saver" that makes development easier, I have identified deno-webui as the best solution.

Goal
Replace the complex Rust-based desktop shell (desktop/) with a single, lightweight Deno configuration. This allows you to run your entire "Discord-style" app with just Deno, utilizing your system's installed browser engine (Edge/Chrome) for the rendering, without the overhead of Electron or the build times of Rust.

The Hybrid "Life Saver" Approach:

UI Shell (deno-webui): Written in pure TypeScript (No Rust compilation).
Physics Engine (math-engine): Retains Rust/WASM for high-performance simulation.
Why: You need heavy math/physics. Pure TS is too slow. Rust compiled to WASM is near-native speed. This gives you the best of both worlds: easy UI development, fast simulation.

User Review Required
IMPORTANT

This change effectively deprecates the desktop/ Cargo project (Tao/Wry). You will no longer need to compile Rust to run the desktop app (only for the WASM math engine).

Prerequisite: Ensure you have Google Chrome or Microsoft Edge installed (which is standard on Windows).

Proposed Changes
Root Directory
[NEW] desktop.ts
This new script will:

Import deno-webui.
Spawn your Fresh server (just like 
main.rs
 did, but in TS).
Create a Frameless Window pointing to localhost.
Handle basic "Window Draggable" logic (since frameless windows need a custom drag region).
Configuration
[MODIFY] 
deno.json
Update tasks to run the new script instead of cargo run.

json
{
  "tasks": {
    "dev:desktop": "deno run -A --unstable-ffi desktop.ts",
    ...
  }
}
Logic & Mathematics
[KEEP] math-engine/ (Rust) We will RETAIN the Rust-based math engine as it provides the necessary performance for heavy simulations. It will continue to be compiled to WASM and loaded by the UI.

[MODIFY] 
deno.json
We will keep task: build:wasm but remove task: build:desktop.

Clean Up
[DELETE] desktop/ directory impact
We will effectively ignore or archive the desktop/ folder. I recommend we keep it for now as a backup, but remove it from the active workflow.

[KEEP] math-engine/
Do NOT delete. Required for simulation performance.

Verification Plan
Automated Tests
None valid for this visual change.
Manual Verification
Run deno task dev:desktop.
Verify:
 Fresh server starts.
 A "Discord-style" dark frameless window opens.
 Content loads from the Fresh server.
 Critical: Window dragging works (we need to inject a small script or CSS to make the titlebar app-region: drag).
