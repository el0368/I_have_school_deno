# 📏 Intro to Ratios

## What You'll Learn

A **ratio** is a way to compare two quantities. After this lesson you will be able to:

- Describe what a ratio means in words and symbols
- Write a ratio in **three different ways**
- Tell the difference between part-to-part and part-to-whole comparisons

---

## Key Concept
A **ratio** compares two quantities.

$$
\text{Ratio} = \frac{A}{B}
$$

## Interactive Lab
Explore volume and surface area in 3D:

<div style={{ height: "500px", margin: "20px 0", border: "1px solid #3f4147", borderRadius: "8px" }}>
  <VolumeSimulator />
</div>

## Example
If you have 2 red balls and 3 blue balls, the ratio of red to blue is $2:3$.

The **ratio** of red apples to green apples is:

$$
\text{red} : \text{green} = 3 : 5
$$

---

## Three Ways to Write a Ratio

All three of these mean exactly the same thing:

| Form | Example |
|------|---------|
| Words | $3 \text{ to } 5$ |
| Colon | $3 : 5$ |
| Fraction | $\dfrac{3}{5}$ |

> ⚠️ **Order matters!** $3 : 5$ is **not** the same as $5 : 3$.
> Always write the quantities **in the order the question asks**.

### Try it — does swapping matter?

## Worked Examples

### Example 1 — Simple Comparison

> In a class there are **4 boys** and **7 girls**. Write the ratio of boys to girls.

**Step 1:** Identify what is being compared.

$$
\text{boys} : \text{girls}
$$

**Step 2:** Write the numbers in the correct order.

$$
4 : 7
$$

**Answer:** The ratio of boys to girls is $4 : 7$ (or "$4$ to $7$" or $\tfrac{4}{7}$).

---

### Example 2 — Ratio from a Picture

> 🔵 🔵 🔵 🔴 🔴
>
> What is the ratio of blue circles to red circles?

**Count:** 3 blue, 2 red

$$
\text{blue} : \text{red} = 3 : 2
$$

---

### Example 3 — Part-to-Whole

> A bag has **2 blue marbles** and **3 yellow marbles** (5 total).
> What is the ratio of blue marbles to **all** marbles?

Here we compare a **part** to the **whole**:

$$
\text{blue} : \text{all} = 2 : 5
$$

## Common Mistakes

| ❌ Mistake | ✅ Correct |
|-----------|-----------|
| Writing the ratio backwards | Always match the order in the question |
| Simplifying when not asked | Leave $4 : 6$ as-is unless told to simplify |
| Thinking ratio $=$ fraction always | $2 : 3$ compares parts; $\tfrac{2}{3}$ means part of a whole |

---

## Key Vocabulary

| Word | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Ratio** | A comparison of two quantities |
| **Terms** | The two numbers in a ratio (e.g. in $3:5$, the terms are $3$ and $5$) |
| **Part-to-Part** | Comparing one group to another group |
| **Part-to-Whole** | Comparing one group to the total |

---

## Key Formula

$$
\boxed{a : b = \frac{a}{b} = a \text{ to } b}
$$

All three forms describe the same ratio. The **order** of $a$ and $b$ determines the meaning.
