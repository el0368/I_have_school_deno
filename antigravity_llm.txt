# Google Antigravity - LLM Reference Documentation

Google Antigravity is an agent-centric Integrated Development Environment (IDE) designed for autonomous AI-assisted software engineering.

## 1. Model Stack (Reasoning & Specialized)

The platform utilizes a multi-model architecture to handle different aspects of the development lifecycle.

### Reasoning Models (Customizable)
Users can select frontier models for core reasoning via the prompt box selector:
- **Gemini 3 Pro** (High/Low variants)
- **Gemini 3 Flash**
- **Claude 4.5** (Sonnet/Opus with Thinking capabilities)
- **GPT-OSS**

### Specialized Models (Non-Customizable)
- **Nano Banana Pro**: Generative image tasks (UI mockups, system diagrams, web assets).
- **Gemini 2.5 Pro UI Checkpoint**: Powers the browser subagent for native DOM interaction.
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash**: Background checkpointing and context summarization.
- **Gemini 2.5 Flash Lite**: Semantic search engine for codebase indexing.

## 2. Agentic Workflows

Workflows are the primary mechanism for standardizing and automating complex development tasks.

- **Definition**: Structured markdown files (`.agent/workflows/*.md`) containing sequences of steps.
- **Execution**: Triggered via slash commands (e.g., `/sovereign-development`) or automated sequences.
- **Composition**: Workflows can call other workflows to form complex automation chains.
- **Capabilities**: Can delegate tasks across the file system, terminal, and browser.

## 3. Artifacts & Verification

Antigravity operates at a "Task" level rather than just a "Chat" level.

- **Artifact Types**:
    - `task.md`: Granular checklist for the current sub-task.
    - `implementation_plan.md`: Technical design and step-by-step logic approved before execution.
    - `walkthrough.md`: Proof-of-work summary with embedded media.
- **Feedback Loop**: Users provide feedback directly on artifacts. The agent incorporates this feedback asynchronously.
- **Verification Gates**: Agents prioritize "Verified Execution" where changes are checked against test suites (e.g., `deno task verify`) before completion.

## 4. Best Practices for Human-Agent Pairing

- **Clear Scoping**: Use `implementation_plan.md` to define the boundary of work.
- **Institutional Memory**: Use `GEMINI.md` for project identity and `SKILL.md` folders for specialized capabilities.
- **Granular Tasks**: Break complex features into small, testable entries in `task.md`.
- **Verified Pushes**: Use pre-commit and pre-push hooks to ensure the agent never commits broken code.
- **Snapshot Testing**: Use deterministic "Golden Snapshots" to prevent logic drift in AI-generated code.
