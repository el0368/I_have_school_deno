## What You'll Learn

A **ratio** is a way to compare two quantities. After this lesson you will be able to:

- Describe what a ratio means in words and symbols
- Write a ratio three different ways
- Identify the two quantities being compared in a real-world situation

---

## Key Idea

A ratio compares **two quantities** that are related to each other.

> There are **3 red apples** and **5 green apples** in a bowl.

The ratio of red apples to green apples is **3 to 5**.

---

## Three Ways to Write a Ratio

All three of these mean exactly the same thing:

| Form     | Example |
| -------- | ------- |
| Words    | 3 to 5  |
| Colon    | 3 : 5   |
| Fraction | 3/5     |

> ⚠️ **Order matters.** "3 to 5" is NOT the same as "5 to 3".\
> Always write the quantities in the order the question asks.

---

## Worked Examples

### Example 1 — Simple comparison

> In a class there are **4 boys** and **7 girls**.\
> Write the ratio of boys to girls.

**Step 1:** Identify what is being compared.\
→ boys : girls

**Step 2:** Write the numbers in the correct order.\
→ 4 : 7

**Answer:** The ratio of boys to girls is **4 : 7** (or "4 to 7" or **4/7**).

### Example 2 — Ratio from a picture

> 🔵 🔵 🔵 🔴 🔴

> What is the ratio of blue circles to red circles?

**Count:** 3 blue, 2 red\
**Answer:** 3 : 2

---

### Example 3 — Part-to-whole ratio

> A bag has **2 blue marbles** and **3 yellow marbles** (5 total).\
> What is the ratio of blue marbles to **all** marbles?

Here we compare a **part** to the **whole**.

**Answer:** 2 : 5

## Common Mistakes

| ❌ Mistake                       | ✅ Correct                                             |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Writing the ratio backwards      | Always match the order stated in the question          |
| Simplifying when not asked       | Leave 4 : 6 as is unless told to simplify              |
| Thinking ratio = fraction always | 2 : 3 compares parts; a fraction means part of a whole |
